# Who I am
As an enthusiastic IT project manager, I possess extensive analytical, communication, and organizational skills that I have honed over 15+ years in software development. My fervor lies in implementing Agile methodologies, especially the Scrum framework, but I also have practical experience in utilizing Kanban boards and the Waterfall methodology.
